Plan

the schema for db should come from llm

default schema keep it each file seperate

need to validate the schema -> retry = 1

___

Thoughts

join the files into one table

converting the schema to something that is easier to query

creating whole database schemas instead of one by one

creating foreign keys between tables

indexes -> probably not less data

find and coerce data type for each column

handle categorical value columns

handle enums
